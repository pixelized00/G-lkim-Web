Depending on the system structure; it is used as a protective coating for the shock absorbing layer, as a binder of EPDM particles in the wear layer and as the final protective layer. In addition, due to its relatively hard structure when used alone, it is also used in places such as gyms, skating, dance, gymnastics halls, health-sports centers, children's playgrounds where weight training is performed.
