It is used for crack repair in concrete and brick walls. Thanks to its high adhesion and bearing properties, it permanently repairs cracks in such facades and floors. It prevents water leaks, discolouration and damages caused by water freezing in concrete. StenCareÂ® 2EP 110 is produced by adding fluidity enhancing and adhesion strength enhancing additives to epoxy resin with high adhesion to concrete. Thanks to this, it penetrates very well into fine cracks even at low pressures and bonds the surfaces together. It is flexibilised, so it can accommodate minor movements of buildings without breaking and separating from the surface."

The polymeric mixture adapts to the thermal expansion of concrete made of Portland cement and adheres very well to concrete. Since its binder is flexible, it is resistant to thermal and mechanical movements. It does not require joints in places subject to minor movements. It is resistant to weak organic and inorganic acids and alkalis; oil, fuel and antifreeze and many chemicals. It is used in the repair of old concrete surfaces, broken ano and joint edges and similar places. It is suitable for use on pedestrian walkways, floors in industrial storage tank areas, airport pedestrian walkways, turning and deceleration zones in parking areas and concrete, mosaic, tile, wood, metal and asphalt surfaces in these places."
